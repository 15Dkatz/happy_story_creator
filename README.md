## Happy Story Creator

This project is a social media kit for our Corporate Social Responsibility activities.

This is a React application built by parcel-bundler.

Currently, it has two main components:

• A `Blogging` component that keeps track of user-contributed posts. This component includes a thermometer visualization to track the overall hours.

• An `Instagram` (Photo Library) component that displays a gallery of volunteering pictures. It also has Proof-of-Concept code for fetching photos from instagram based on a public hashtag. Instagram needs to approve a development application for access to the `public` scope of the api.

### Blogging

The blogging component leverages the Zendesk Garden design system to keep the added UI accessible and on-brand.

It supports entries for a post-heading and post-content, and could potentially support user-uploaded images in the future.

These images could also appear on a modified version of the photo library.

### Partner spotlights

Pages could be created in the future to feature our various volunteering partners. These would display a small descriptive paragraph of the partner as well as a feed of images contributed by internal employees and Instagram posts with specific hashtags
