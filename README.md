## Happy Story Creator

This project is a social media kit for our Corporate Social Responsibility activities.

This is a React application built by parcel-bundler.

Currently, it has two main components:

• A `Blogging` component that keeps track of user-contributed posts. This component includes a thermometer visualization to track the overall hours.

• An `Instgram` (Photo Library) component that displays a gallery of volunteering pictures. It also has Proof-of-Concept code for fetching photos from instagram based on a public hashtag. Instagram needs to approve a development application for access to the `public` scope of the api.
